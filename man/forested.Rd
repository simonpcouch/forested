A data frame with 7,107 rows and 19 columns:

\describe{
\item{forested}{Whether the plot is classified as "forested" or not,
as a factor with levels \code{"Yes"} and \code{"No"}.}
\item{year}{Year when the plot was classified "on-the-ground" as forested
or not. The remaining, remotely-sensed variables are measured at
different times or averaged over multiple years.}

with levels \code{"Tree"} and \code{"No tree"}.}
\item{dew_temp}{Mean annual dewpoint temperature (1991-2020), in degrees
Celcius.}
\item{precip_annual}{Mean annual precipitation (1991-2020), in mm Ã— 100.}

degrees Celcius.}
\item{temp_january_min}{Mean minimum temperature in January (1991-2020), in
degrees Celcius.}
\item{vapor_min, vapor_max}{Minimum and maximum annual vapor pressure
deficit (1991-2020), in Pa x 100.}

\description{
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and
Analysis (FIA) Program provides all sorts of
estimates of forest attributes for uses in research, legislation, and land
management. The FIA uses a set of criteria to classify a plot of land as
"forested" or "non-forested," and that classification is a central data
point in many decision-making contexts. A small subset of plots in
Washington State are sampled and assessed "on-the-ground" as forested or
non-forested, but the FIA has access to remotely sensed data for all land
in the state. Practitioners can develop a model on the more easily-accessible
remotely sensed data to predict whether a plot is forested or non-forested.
