Description: A small subset of plots in Washington State are sampled and 
     assessed "on-the-ground" as forested or non-forested by the U.S. 
     Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis
     (FIA) Program, but the FIA also has access to remotely sensed data for 
     all land in the state. The 'forested' package contains a data frame by the
     same name intended for use in predictive modeling applications
     where the more easily-accessible remotely sensed data can be used to 
     predict whether a plot is forested or non-forested.
