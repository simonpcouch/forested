Description: A small subset of plots throughout the U.S. are sampled and
    assessed "on-the-ground" as forested or non-forested by the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and
    Analysis (FIA) Program, but the FIA also has access to remotely sensed
    data for all land in the country. The 'forested' package contains data
    frames intended for use in predictive modeling applications where the more
    easily-accessible remotely sensed data can be used to predict whether a plot 
    is forested or non-forested. Currently, the package provides data for
    Washington and Georgia.
